.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]newprogram\f[] \- generates a new C program with properties
determined by options chosen by the user.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]newprogram\f[] [\f[B]\-h\f[]] [\f[B]\-\-help\f[]]
.PP
\f[B]newprogram\f[] [options] project_name
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]newprogram\f[] creates a new directory under the users designated
\f[I]programs directory\f[], creates the main C program based on the
project_name input.
If the project_name was \f[I]someThing\f[] then the new project dir will
be \f[I]Something\f[] and the main program \f[I]something.c\f[].
The resulting binary will be \f[I]something\f[] and the manpage
\f[I]something.1\f[].
All required \f[I]autotools\f[] files will be generated and any optional
software dependencies will be entered into the \f[I]Makefile.am\f[].
Such dependencies, if found within the user designated source file
sub\-dir will be hard linked into the project dir, or if found within
the user designated boilerplate dir will be copied there for subsequent
editing.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[B]\-h, \-\-help\f[]
Displays this help message then quits.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-\-depends, \-d\f[] software_name or \[aq]list of software names\[aq]
Specify additional software dependencies to be recorded in Makefile.am.
Names that have both a header file and C program file may be input as
\[aq]name.h+c\[aq].
You may use the option as \-d \[aq]name1.h+c name2.c+h ...\[aq] or use
the option multiple times on different names.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-\-with\-options, \-o\f[]
The files gopt.c and gopt.h will automatically be included in the
software dependencies list.
These will be generated from stub files located in your config dir.
These stubs will be installed there on the first run of this program.
Help text for the target program is provided automatically for when the
\f[B]\-\-help\f[] option is selected.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-\-options\-list, \-n\f[] optcode
where \f[B]optcode\f[] looks like this \f[I]xextra:\f[], x is the short
option name, \f[I]extra\f[] is the long option name, and the string may
be ended with 0, 1 or 2 occurrences of \f[B]\[aq]:\[aq]\f[], indicating
0; no option argument, 1; option argument is required, and 2; an option
argument is optional.
All code required to process your named options will be generated
including some \[aq]nonsense\[aq] help text to describe these options.
As for the \f[B]\-\-depends\f[] option this option may be invoked once
on a quote protected, space separated list of \f[B]opcodes\f[] or
invoked several times on single items or shorter lists.
If this option is invoked, the \f[B]\-\-with\-options\f[] option is
redundant but harmless.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-\-extra\-dist, \-x\f[] data_file or \[aq]file1 file2 ...\[aq]
File(s) to be installed as data in \f[I]/usr/local/share/\f[] such as
config files.
Extra\-dist may be invoked more than once if needed or the list of files
may be quote protected for a single invocation.
.RS
.RE
.SH NOTE
.PP
There is no need for any action to be taken about the manpage.
At present it will be empty at creation time and should be written up as
the target prgram is being developed.
In future a rudimentary manpage will be generated based on the generated
options.
